# deprecation

Challenges in Lab 1&2 were implemented directly in lab 1 branch that would be inherited by further labs, which might conflict with further labs. After finding this problem in lab 3, I rename lab3 to lab3-color and mark this branch as deprecated.

A new commit will be added after lab2's final commit to clean up all challenge implementations then lab 2 will be merged into mit_origin/lab3. In further labs, challenge will be implementd in new branches.
